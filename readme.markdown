# [Matthew Hartman](http://matthewhartman.com.au)

Hi there, the name's Matthew Hartman, as you've probably figured out by now, and I'm a passionate front end developer with over 10 years of industry experience.

When I'm not working, I'm either hanging out with my wife and daughter, travelling the world, socialising with friends, becoming a better table tennis player or being a good foodie.
